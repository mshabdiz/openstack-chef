      <h2>Testing only, please.</h2>
      <p><strong>Rule No. 1: Remember that TryStack is designed exclusively as a testing sandbox.</strong> We wanted a fast, easy way for developers to test code against a real OpenStack environment, without having to stand up hardware themselves. It probably goes without saying that this is not the place for production code - you should host only test code and test servers here. In fact, your account on TryStack will be periodically wiped to help make sure no one account tries to rule tyrannically over our democracy. Play nice in the sandbox!</p>

      <h2>How do I get an account?</h2>
      <p>For now, we've worked to make the process as simple as possible: Just join our Facebook Group and we'll manually create your account and send you the details. (We hear you about Facebook and we're working on adding other alternatives, too.)</p>
      <p>Once your request is approved, you can go to a dashboard link and click Login with Facebook. At the moment, we are approving requests manually, so please allow up to a couple days to process your request.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> In order to receive our private message, you should friend TryStack Admin Facebook account.</p></div>
      <h2>How long does creating an account take?</h2>
      <p>There's a manual approval step in our process, so it may take a little time for you to get access to TryStack. Please be patient. We're imagining quite a few accounts will be requested at launch. We promise to work through them as fast as possible.</p>

      <h2>How do I get help?</h2>
      <p>There are a few great avenues available to get help. For quick API reference, the OpenStack Compute and OpenStack Identity APIs are well documented at <a href="http://api.openstack.org/">api.openstack.org</a>. It would also serve you well to spend a moment reading the <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/api/quick-start/content/">API Quick Start Guide</a>. More OpenStack documentation is also available at <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/">docs.openstack.org</a>. Finally, OpenStack has a very active IRC channel #openstack. You can quickly connect right in your browser using <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/">The FreeNode Browser Client</a>.</p>

      <h2>Usage</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="span10">
      <h2>What can I do with TryStack?</h2>
      <p>TryStack, in large part, resembles the type of cloud environment you can create on your own with OpenStack Software. However, we have set a few sensible limits in place for the good of the project. First, the server instances you launch are only available for 24 hours until the hardware is reclaimed for use by new instances. Secondly, you can't upload your own server images, you can only select from two available images (Ubuntu Oneiric Ocelot and Natty Narwhal). Finally, not all APIs and features of OpenStack are available. The two APIs you can use currently are the OpenStack Compute API and the OpenStack Identity Services API.</p>
      <h2>How should I use TryStack?</h2>
      <p><strong>For testing purposes only&mdash;TryStack is a testing environment by design.</strong> Instances are typically deleted after 24 hours, so for obvious reasons you should <strong>NOT</strong> put any data on this cloud you don't want to lose.</p>
      <h2>Wait... the server instances I create won't last forever?</h2>
      <p>You got it. Scripts run periodically to remove instances after 24-hours. Your instances may also be removed if your account runs out of credits (lovingly called Stack Dollars). You can read more about how that all works below. </p>
      <h2>Is there an SLA?</h2>
      <p>Since this cloud is managed by volunteers in the OpenStack community, there is no SLA. The cloud may go down from time to time for maintenance or to upgrade to the latest release of OpenStack.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="span2">
      <h2>Credits</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="span10">
      <h2>What are "Stack Dollars"?</h2>
      <p>When you first get your account, it will be preloaded with a set amount of credits called Stack Dollars. At any time, you can check how many Stack Dollars you have available to you in the Dashboard. Certain activities (whether performed in the Dashboard or via API) consume Stack Dollars. For example, launching a new instance consumes 100. Running instances consume Stack Dollars every ten minutes they are run. The amount of Stack Dollars consumed varies depending on the size of each instance. The bigger the instance, the faster your Stack Dollars will be consumed.</p>
      <p>Don't get too hung up on Stack Dollars, they are really just there to prevent abuse. You should find you have ample credits available for almost any testing scenario. One tip: If the size of the server instances you launch doesn't matter too much to your tests and experimentation, you'll get more life out of your account by launching smaller instances. (Plus you'll get karma points since there will be more capacity available to others.)</p>
